\emph{Software engineer}

{\small Member of a team creating native mobile client software development kits
  (SDKs) to allow publishers to serve video advertisements within their
  applications.

  Helped create the next iteration of SpotX's SDK offering that serves millions

  Improved product quality and developer feedback by introducing a number of
  tools and practices. These include \emph{the reproducible build},
  \emph{continuous integration} (with Jenkins), and \emph{specification by
    example}.

  Increased developer confidence in making changes and deploying code to
  production by building out a comprehensive test suite as part of the build
  pipeline. }

  The application provides an interface for clients to more accurately and
  intuitively track user demand and car supply, enabling them to more
  effectively manage their fleet of vehicles. }

\emph{Software developer intern}

Completed a contract to redevelop an accounting platform. I reduced the existing
codebase by hundreds of lines of code, modularised many of the existing
features, and remade the UI. This resulted in a codebase that was easier to work
with and a finished product with an improved user experience.
