I provide technical solutions to on-demand business problems. Specializing in
web technologies and Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Heroku (my preferred hosting
platform), I develop products for my clients' businesses.

I work on corporate websites, dynamic web applications, and data APIs. My
products are responsive on all the popular web browsers and they serve users
on desktops, laptops, mobile devices, and tablets.

Member of a team creating native mobile client software development kits (SDKs)
to allow publishers to serve video advertisements within their applications.

Helped create the next iteration of SpotX's SDK offering that serves millions of
advertisement impressions daily.

Improved product quality and developer feedback by introducing a number of tools
and practices. These include \emph{the reproducible build}, \emph{continuous
  integration} (with Jenkins), and \emph{specification by example}.

Increased developer confidence in making changes and deploying code to
production by building out a comprehensive test suite as part of the build
pipeline.

Worked with a team creating a greenfield underwriting platform to analyse bank
statements and extract data to assist in identifying a business' loan risk
potential.

Improved the feedback loop by introducing a CircleCI pipeline, in addition
to fleshing out the testing infrastucture across the Clojure/ClojureScript
stack.

Increased release safety and confidence by creating a staging environment in
Heroku for the purpose of exploratory testing a production-like environment
before release.

Partnered with Denver University to assist in teaching a part-time course on
full-stack web development.

Taught and mentored over 60 students in fundamental programming practice and
the use of emerging tools in the frontend and backend (Node.js) ecosystems.

Led to completion the construction of the front-end of a predictive analytics
platform. This improved the firm's product offering with a web application that
offers intuitive visualisations and mappings of hundreds of thousands of data
points in multiple languages.

The application provides an interface for clients to more accurately and
intuitively track user demand and car supply, enabling them to more effectively
manage their fleet of vehicles.

Empowered MIAC and its clients to exchange files more quickly and securely than
the existing FTP approach by building a greenfield, web-based, file-exchange
application.

Completed a contract to redevelop an accounting platform. I reduced the existing
codebase by hundreds of lines of code, modularised many of the existing
features, and remade the UI. This resulted in a codebase that was easier to work
with and a finished product with an improved user experience.
