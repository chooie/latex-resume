Improved product quality and developer feedback by introducing a number of tools
and practices. These include \emph{the reproducible build}, \emph{continuous
integration} (with Jenkins), and \emph{specification by example}.

Increased developer confidence in making changes and deploying code to
production by building out a comprehensive test suite as part of the build
pipeline.

Led to completion the construction of the front-end of a predictive analytics
platform. This improved the firm's product offering with a web application that
offers intuitive visualizations and mappings of hundreds of thousands of data
points in multiple languages.

The application provides an interface for clients to more accurately and
intuitively track user demand and car supply, enabling them to more effectively
manage their fleet of vehicles.

Completed a contract to redevelop an accounting platform. I reduced the existing
codebase by hundreds of lines of code, modularised many of the existing
features, and remade the UI. This resulted in a codebase that was easier to work
with and a finished product with an improved user experience.
